UPDATE NAVBAR.JS AND ONLOAD.JS ANYTIME NEW PAGES/NAVBAR LINKS ARE ADDED IN

THIS IS A SETUP CLOSE TO HOW REACT.JS WORKS, BUT WILL NOT HAVE THE ROUTING ISSUES THAT ARE SO PREVALENT WITH REACT

EACH PAGE WILL REQUIRE AN HTML FILE WITH THE PAGE'S NAME, BUT ALL HTML FILES WILL BE THE SAME AS THE INDEX.HTML
- THE JS FILE THAT MATCHES THE HTML FILE IN QUESTION WILL HANDLE ATTACHING THE PAGE'S CONTENT TO THE HTML PAGE
- THE ONLOAD.JS IS WHAT WILL BE TRIGGERED ON LOAD WITH EVERY HTML PAGE.
- THERE IS A SWITCH FUNCTION THAT WILL HANDLE DECIDING WHICH JS FILE TO TRIGGER BASED ON THE CURRENT URL

THIS WILL ALLOW FOR THE USE OF "COMPONENTS", AND WILL ALLOW FOR LESS REPETITIVE CODE TO BE USED OVERALL.
